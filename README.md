Welcome to this *dataset* repository for our paper "[*Assertiveness-based Agent Communication for a Personalized Medicine on Medical Imaging Diagnosis*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580682)" ([10.1145/3544548.3580682](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580682)) in [proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3544548) ([CHI '23](https://chi2023.acm.org/)) presented during the "[AI in Health](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2023/program/session/97368)" track. In our work, several *datasets* are fostering innovation in higher-level functions for everyone, everywhere. By providing this repository, we hope to encourage the research community to focus on hard problems. In this repository, we present our severity *rates* ([BIRADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS)) of clinicians while diagnosing several patients from our [User Tests and Analysis 11 (UTA11)](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/User-Research#test-11-assertiveness-based-assistant-pre-master-thesis-of-jo%C3%A3o-fernandes-) study. Here, we provide a *dataset* for the measurements of severity *rates* ([BIRADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS)) concerning the patient diagnostic. Work and results are published on a top [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) conference named [CHI 2023](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi) ([page](https://chi2023.acm.org/)). Results were analyzed and interpreted from our [`sa-uta11-results`](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/sa-uta11-results) repository charts. On the same hand, the hereby *dataset* represents the pieces of information of both [BreastScreening](https://BreastScreening.github.io) and [MIDA](https://mida-project.github.io) projects. These projects are research projects that deal with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). From a developed User Interface (UI) and *framework*, these deep networks will incorporate [several datasets](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Datasets) in different modes. For more information about the available *datasets* please follow the [Datasets](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Datasets) page on the [Wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki) of the [`meta`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta) information repository. Last but not least, you can find further information on the [Wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-rates/wiki) in this repository. We also have several demos to see in our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPz4aTIVHekHXTxHTUOLmXw), please follow us.

abstract = {Intelligent agents are showing increasing promise for clinical decision-making in a variety of healthcare settings. While a substantial body of work has contributed to the best strategies to convey these agents‚Äô decisions to clinicians, few have considered the impact of personalizing and customizing these communications on the clinicians‚Äô performance and receptiveness. This raises the question of how intelligent agents should adapt their tone in accordance with their target audience. We designed two approaches to communicate the decisions of an intelligent agent for breast cancer diagnosis with different tones: a suggestive (non-assertive) tone and an imposing (assertive) one. We used an intelligent agent to inform about: (1) number of detected findings; (2) cancer severity on each breast and per medical imaging modality; (3) visual scale representing severity estimates; (4) the sensitivity and specificity of the agent; and (5) clinical arguments of the patient, such as pathological co-variables. Our results demonstrate that assertiveness plays an important role in how this communication is perceived and its benefits. We show that personalizing assertiveness according to the professional experience of each clinician can reduce medical errors and increase satisfaction, bringing a novel perspective to the design of adaptive communication between intelligent agents and clinicians.},

## Prerequisites

The following list is showing the required dependencies for this project to run locally:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or any other Git or GitHub version control tool
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.5 or newer)

Here are some tutorials and documentation, if needed, to feel more comfortable about using and playing around with this repository:

* [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [GitHub Quick Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Usage

Usage follow the instructions here to setup the current repository and extract the present data. To understand how the hereby repository is used for, read the following steps.

### Installation

At this point, the only way to install this repository is manual. Eventually, this will be accessible through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or any other package manager, as mentioned on the [roadmap](#Roadmap).

Nonetheless, this kind of installation is as simple as cloning this repository. Virtually all Git and GitHub version control tools are capable of doing that. Through the console, we can use the command below, but other ways are also fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/dataset-uta11-rates.git
```

Optionally, the module/directory can be installed into the designated Python interpreter by moving it into the site-packages directory at the respective Python directory.

### Demonstration

Please, feel free to try out our demo. It is a script called `demo.py` at the `src/` directory. It can be used as follows:

```bash
python src/demo.py
```

Just keep in mind this is just a demo, so it does nothing more than downloading data to an arbitrary destination directory if the directory does not exist or does not have any content. Also, we did our best to make the demo as user-friendly as possible, so, above everything else, have fun! üòÅ

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code to pip or any other package manager. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.
